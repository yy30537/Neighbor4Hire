## Back End Dependencies

- `express`': A web framework for Node.js. Used to create the REST API and handle HTTP requests/responses.

- `mongoose`: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. Simplifies interacting with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution.

- `bcryptjs`: A library for hashing passwords. Used to securely store user passwords in the database (never store plain-text passwords).

- `jsonwebtoken`: A library for generating and verifying JWTs. Used for user authentication and authorization.

- `cors`: A middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Allows the front end (running on a different port or domain) to communicate with the back end.

- `dotenv`: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file. Used to store sensitive configuration (e.g., database connection strings, JWT secret key).


## Front End Dependencies

- `axios`: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests. Used to communicate with the back end from the front end.

- `react-router-dom`: A library for handling routing in React applications. Used to navigate between different pages (e.g., Home, Login, Signup).
